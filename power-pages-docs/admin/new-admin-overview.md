# Use the new Power Platform admin center (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

We're introducing a new Power Platform admin center, which has features organized into pages like **Manage**, **Security**, and **Copilot**. The [classic Power Platform admin center](admin-overview.md) is still available, and you can easily switch between them at your convenience.

## New vs classic admin center

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use the classic Power Platform admin center, you can still access all Power Pages management features, including inventory (your sites), analytics, licenses, and the security dashboard. Learn more in [Use the admin center](./admin-overview.md).

If a Power Pages feature is missing in the new admin center, switch back to the classic admin center to access it. We're working to achieve full parity between the two experiences for seamless usability.

Thank you for your patience as we work toward a streamlined, modern admin experience.
