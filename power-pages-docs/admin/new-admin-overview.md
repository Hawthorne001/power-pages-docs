# Use the new Power Platform admin center (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

We're introducing the *new Power Platform admin center*, available alongside the *classic Power Platform admin center*. Admins can switch between the two, with features organized into pages like *Manage*, *Security*, and *Copilot*. This switch lets you explore the new experience at your convenience.

## Access Power Pages management views

In the new admin center, accessing Power Pages views is straightforward and maintains continuity with the [classic admin center experience](admin-overview.md):

1. **Your sites and analytics views**:

    These views are in the **Manage** page under the **Products** section. Admins can find a list of all their Power Pages sites and detailed analytics insights here.

1. **Licenses view**:
  
    The Power Pages licenses view is now available on the **Licensing** page. This view lets admins manage license-related aspects for Power Pages directly within the new admin center.

1. **Security dashboard**:
  
    For security insights and actions, go to the **Security** page. Under the **Products** section, select **Power Pages**. The security dashboard offers the same features as the classic admin center. Learn more at [Manage website security from the Power Platform admin center (preview)](./admin-center-security.md).

## Classic admin center

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using the classic Power Platform admin center, you can still access all Power Pages management features, including inventory (your sites), analytics, licenses, and the security dashboard. Learn more at [Use the admin center](./admin-overview.md).

If a specific Power Pages feature is missing in the new admin center, switch back to the classic admin center to access it. We're working to achieve full parity between the two experiences for seamless usability.

Thank you for your patience as we work towards a streamlined, modern admin experience.
