This article focuses on using the new admin center for Power Pages. Learn more about all the features in the new admin center at [Use the new Power Platform admin center (preview)](/power-platform/admin/new-admin-center).

## Access Power Pages management views

Access Power Pages views in the new admin center, similar to the [classic admin center experience](admin-overview.md):

1. **Your sites and analytics views**:

    Find these views on the **Manage** page under the **Products** section. Here, you can see a list of all your Power Pages sites and detailed analytics insights.

    :::image type="content" source=".//Media/new-admin-center/analytics-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of analytics view in the Manage page.":::

1. **Licenses view**:
  
    Find the Power Pages licenses view on the **Licensing** page to manage license-related aspects for Power Pages directly within the new admin center.

1. **Security dashboard**:

    For security insights and actions, go to the **Security** page and select **Power Pages** under the **Products** section. The security dashboard offers the same features as the classic admin center. Learn more at [Manage website security from the Power Platform admin center (preview)](./admin-center-security.md).

## Classic admin center

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use the classic Power Platform admin center, you can still access all Power Pages management features, including inventory (your sites), analytics, licenses, and the security dashboard. Learn more at [Use the admin center](./admin-overview.md).

If a Power Pages feature is missing in the new admin center, switch back to the classic admin center to access it. We're working to achieve full parity between the two experiences for seamless usability.

Thank you for your patience as we work toward a streamlined, modern admin experience.
