# Manage sites

Your Power Pages home serves as the central hub for managing all your sites. Here you can view a list of all sites in your selected environment and take action for each website.

For each website in your environment, the site card provides details about the site, such as:

- Site name and web address

- Site creator's name

- Suggested next steps, as you build and edit your site

- A thumbnail that captures a snapshot of your site. If your website is authenticated, this thumbnail will show the sign-in page that your users will see.

Each site card also links to actions such as:

- Edit, which redirects you to the [design studio](../getting-started/use-design-studio.md) experience.

- Preview, which gives you a glimpse of how your users will view the website.

- Share, which creates a link you can send others to preview the site.

- Details, which will take you to the Set up workspace.

- Portal Management app, which launches the Portal Management app.

- Admin center, which will take you to the Power Platform admin center. 

- Delete, which deletes the site and removes it from the site list.
