# Manage website authentication key

Power Pages connectivity architecture explained how a website connects to Microsoft Dataverse environment. When a website is created, a new authentication key is generated with the public key uploaded to Microsoft Entra application. Power Pages uses this authentication key to connect to the Dataverse environment. You must renew the key once every year to ensure that your website can connect to Dataverse environment. If the authentication key isn't renewed, your website will not be accessible to your end users once the authentication key expires. 

## Check authentication key details

> [!TIP]
> To learn about the roles required to perform this task, read [Admin roles required for website administrative tasks](/power-apps/maker/portals/admin/portal-admin-roles).

The details of an authentication key are displayed on Power Platform admin center and the website.

**Power Platform admin center**

1. Open the [Power Platform admin center](https://aka.ms/ppac).

1. In the **Resources** section, select **Power Pages sites**.

## Check authentication key expiration notification

Before the authentication key expires, you receive notifications via emails, Power Platform admin center, and the website.
