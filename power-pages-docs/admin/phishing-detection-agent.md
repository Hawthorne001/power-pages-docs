# Phishing detection and remediation in Power Pages

Phishing detection for Power Pages helps protect your organization from phishing threats by proactively detecting suspicious activities, suspending compromised sites, and notifying administrators with actionable insights.

## Key Features

- **Detection**: The system continuously monitors site activities for suspicious patterns.
- **Suspension**: If a site is flagged as compromised and the phishing activity is verified by Microsoft, the affected site is automatically suspended to prevent further damage.
- **Notification**: Tenant admins are notified through email, Teams, and the Power Platform admin center (PPAC) when a phishing site is suspended.
- **Dispute support**: If a site is incorrectly flagged, tenant admins can raise a support ticket with Microsoft to request a review and reinstate the site.

## Admin Experience

- Notifications appear in the Power Platform admin center > **Manage** > **Power Pages** > **Your sites**. They also appear on the portal hub page, which opens after you select a specific site from **Your sites**.  
- Emails and Teams notifications are sent to tenant admins when a suspension occurs.  
- A direct link to contact Microsoft Support is included in the email, Teams, and PPAC notification messages for disputes.  


## Next Steps for Admins

- Monitor notifications in PPAC, email, and Teams for security-related actions.  
- Promptly review suspended sites and raise a support ticket to dispute if needed.  
- Educate makers in your organization about secure site creation best practices.
