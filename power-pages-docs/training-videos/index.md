## Configure table permissions

Business information in Dataverse can't automatically be viewed in Power Pages. To allow access to Dataverse records in Power Pages sites, you'll need to configure table permissions and associate the table permissions to web roles.

The following will explain the concepts of table permissions, setting up access, and assigning web roles.

## Configure access to your site

Power Pages has a robust security model to ensure that business information is properly protected. 

Users can be provided access to your site through authentication. Power Pages users are represented by Dataverse contact records. Power Pages can be integrated with many authentication providers such as Azure Active Directory B2C, Microsoft, LinkedIn, and others.

The following videos provide an overview of authentication and walk you through configuring an identity provider.
