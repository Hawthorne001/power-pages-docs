# SAP Supplier Self Service template

Use the SAP Supplier Self Service template for Power Pages to empower your suppliers with self-service capabilities, enabling them to manage their vendors, orders, and invoices efficiently.

## Overview

The SAP supplier portal template complements the [SAP Procurement template](/power-platform/enterprise-templates/finance/sap-procurement/overview) by extending its functionality to supplier and vendor use cases, offering self-service capabilities. This sample website showcases the listing, creation, and updating of SAP business records related to vendors, orders, and invoices. Designed to demonstrate supplier self-service capabilities, the template helps customers quickly derive value while being adaptable and extensible to their specific business needs. It utilizes the same architecture as the SAP Procurement template, using Power Automate cloud flows and the [SAP ERP connector](/connectors/saperp/) for seamless integration. The template is packaged as a solution that can be easily imported into existing environments and used with Power Pages websites. The solutions are available on [GitHub](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2281377).
