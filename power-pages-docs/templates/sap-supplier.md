# SAP supplier enterprise template

Use the SAP supplier self-service site template for Power Pages to empower your suppliers with self-service capabilities, enabling them to manage their vendors, orders, and invoices efficiently.

## Overview

The SAP supplier portal template complements the [SAP Procurement template](/power-platform/enterprise-templates/finance/sap-procurement/overview) by extending its functionality to supplier and vendor use cases, offering self-service capabilities. This sample website showcases the listing, creation, and updating of SAP business records related to vendors, orders, and invoices. Designed to demonstrate supplier self-service capabilities, the template helps customers quickly derive value while being adaptable and extensible to their specific business needs. It utilizes the same architecture as the SAP Procurement template, leveraging Power Automate cloud flows and the SAP ERP connector for seamless integration. Packaged as a solution, it can be easily imported into existing environments and used with Power Pages websites. The solutions are available on [GitHub](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2281377).
