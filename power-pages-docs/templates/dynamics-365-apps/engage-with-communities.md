# Engage with communities by using the community site

Keep your customer engagement strong by growing a community, publishing articles, gathering user feedback, and acting on user-provided ideas. With out-of-the-box solutions available with Power Pages you can:

- Allow your users to hold conversations by posting messages on a forum. A forum can contain a number of topics, also known as threads, and can be replied to by many users. More Information: [Set up and manage forums](setup-manage-forums.md)  

- Manage multiple corporate or community blogs on a single site, with multiple authors per blog. More Information: [Manage blogs](manage-blogs.md)  

- Engage with and gather feedback from your community, including ideas, votes, and comments on suggestions. More Information: [Crowdsource ideas](crowdsource-ideas.md)  

- Engage with customers with a modern case management system. More Information: [Manage cases in Power Pages](case-management.md)
