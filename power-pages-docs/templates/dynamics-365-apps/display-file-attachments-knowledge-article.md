# Display file attachments with knowledge articles

Knowledge articles help you achieve self-service. As a Knowledge Manager, you might want to share some downloadable files along with your articles to provide detailed information or a case study. You can author knowledge articles and add them as notes attachments that can be used by users. These attachments aren't displayed automatically on Power Pages, thereby limiting the effectiveness of self-service.

To display knowledge articles with downloadable file attachments, you must [create the site setting](/power-apps/maker/portals/configure/configure-site-settings) KnowledgeManagement/DisplayNotes, and set the value to true. When you set the site setting to true, knowledge articles are displayed along with their attachments, so users can search for these attachments.

To search for knowledge article attachments in the website, for knowledge authors, you'll want to use the attachments function in the knowledge article editor instead of adding attachments in the notes section. If you've enabled **Sync knowledge article attachments**, knowledge article attachments will automatically be synced to the notes attachment. To learn how to create knowledge article attachments, see [Add a file attachment to a knowledge article](/dynamics365/customer-service/customer-service-hub-user-guide-knowledge-article#add-a-file-attachment-to-a-knowledge-article).
