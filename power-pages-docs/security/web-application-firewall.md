# Web Application Firewall (WAF) for Power Pages 

Web Application Firewall (WAF) provides centralized protection for Power Pages sites, defending against common exploits and vulnerabilities by preventing malicious attacks before they enter the network. By utilizing WAF, Power Pages sites receive global protection at a scale without sacrificing performance.
