# Use the Visual Studio Code extension

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight, powerful source code editor for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It supports JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages like C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, and Go, and runtimes like .NET and Unity. Learn more about Visual Studio Code in [Get started with VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos).

Visual Studio Code allows you to extend your capability through
[extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/extend). Visual Studio Code
extensions can add more features to the overall experience. With the release of
this feature, you can now use the Visual Studio Code extension to work with Power Pages.

### Visual Studio Code extension for Power Pages

The **Power Platform Tools** adds the capability to configure websites using Visual Studio Code, and use the built-in Liquid language [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) enabling help with code completion, assistance, and hinting while customizing websites interface using Visual Studio Code. Using the Visual Studio Code extension, you can also configure portals through the [Microsoft Power Platform CLI](power-platform-cli.md).

> [!NOTE]
> - You need to ensure that [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) is downloaded and installed on the same workstation as Visual Studio Code for the Power Pages features to work.
> - Make sure that only **Power Platform Tools** are installed and not both **Power Platform Tools** and **Power Platform Tools [PREVIEW]**. See [known issues](../known-issues.md#visual-studio-code-extension-for-power-pages) for details.

    :::image type="content" source="media/vs-code-extension/vs-code-extension.png" alt-text="Select Power Platform Tools.":::

1. Select **Install**.

1. Verify the extension is installed successfully from the status messages.

> [!TIP]
> The Power Platform Tools Extension automatically enables using Microsoft Power Platform CLI commands from within Visual Studio Code through [Visual Studio Integrated Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal).

## Power Pages Actions

Power Pages Actions streamline site management and reduce reliance on [Microsoft Power Platform CLI commands](power-platform-cli-tutorial.md#step-3-download-website-content). Power Pages Actions is available in the pane titled **Power Pages Actions** in the Explorer sidebar of Visual Studio Code.

Within this pane, sites are categorized as follows:

- **Active Sites**: Sites that are currently available and active in the selected environment.
- **Inactive Sites**: Sites that are present in the environment but not currently active.
- **Other Sites**: Sites downloaded locally but not yet associated with the selected environment.

### Changing environments

To switch environments:

1. Select on the **Change Environment** button within the Power Pages Actions pane.

    :::image type="content" source="media/vs-code-extension/changeEnv.png" alt-text="Change environment for sites":::

1. Select your desired environment from the displayed list.

When you select an environment, the list of sites updates automatically.

### Actions for sites

Different types of sites provide context-specific actions that you can access by right-clicking.

#### Active Sites actions

Right-click on Active Sites to access the following actions:

- **Preview**: Clears the cache and opens the site within VS Code for immediate [preview](#site-preview).
- **Upload**: Uploads local changes back to your environment.
- **Download**: Downloads the site content to a local folder for offline editing.
- **Site Details**: Displays detailed information about the site.
- **Reveal in Explorer**: Navigates to the local directory containing the site's code.
- **Open in Power Pages Studio**: Opens the site in Power Pages studio.

#### Inactive Sites actions

Inactive Sites provide these actions:

- **Open Site Management**: Opens the site within the Power Pages management application.
- **Site Details**: Provides detailed information about the selected site like website ID, website URL, data model version and more.

#### Other Sites actions

Sites stored locally but not yet in your environment offer the following actions:

- **Upload Site**: Uploads the local site to your connected environment. After uploading, the site appears in the Inactive Sites list, where you can activate it from Power Pages home.
- **Reveal in Explorer**: Navigates to the local directory containing the site's code.

## File icons

The Visual Studio Code extension for Power Pages automatically identifies and shows icons for files and folders inside the downloaded website content.

:::image type="content" source="media/vs-code-extension/file-icons.png" alt-text="List of files in a starter template with website-specific file icon theme.":::

Visual Studio Code uses the default [file icon theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_file-icon-themes) which doesnâ€™t show Power Pages specific icons. To view file icons specific to your websites, you have to update the Visual Studio Code instance to use the Power Pages specific file icon theme.

To enable a portals-specific file-icon theme:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

1. Go to **File** > **Preferences** > **Theme** > **File Icon Theme**

1. Select the theme for **PowerApps portals Icons**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/vs-code-extension/select-theme-icons.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows selecting the theme for Power Apps Portals Icons.":::

## Site preview

The preview action uses the [Microsoft Edge DevTools extension for Visual Studio Code](/microsoft-edge/visual-studio-code/microsoft-edge-devtools-extension) to provide an in-editor site preview. This feature runs Microsoft Edge DevTools and an embedded Microsoft Edge browser with device emulation right inside VS Code, giving you nearly all of the same debugging and inspection capabilities found in the full Microsoft Edge DevTools.  

The preview always shows the changes you uploaded to your site, so ensure you push any local edits before opening it. Each time you launch the preview, the site cache clears automatically to ensure you view the most recent updates.  

To open the preview, right-click your active site under [Power Pages Actions](#power-pages-actions), and select **Preview**. This action opens the embedded Microsoft Edge browser pointing to your chosen site.

:::image type="content" source="media/vs-code-extension/site-preview-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Power Pages site preview action.":::

The preview pane opens on the right side.

:::image type="content" source="media/vs-code-extension/site-preview.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the file list, open file in Visual Studio Code editor, and a preview on the right side.":::

## Autocomplete

The autocomplete capability in the Visual Studio Code extension shows the current context being edited, and the relevant autocomplete elements through IntelliSense.

:::image type="content" source="media/vs-code-extension/auto-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot with an example of autocomplete for the page template ID.":::

### Liquid tags

When customizing downloaded content using Visual Studio Code, you can now use IntelliSense for Power Pages [Liquid tags](liquid/liquid-tags.md).

Start typing to see a list of Liquid tags. Select a tag to format it correctly and continue with your input.
