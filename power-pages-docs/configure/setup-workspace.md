# Overview of the Power Pages Set up workspace

You use the **Set up** workspace to configure key aspects of your Power Pages site.

## General

The general section allows you to configure site-specific details, and the checklist that helps prepare for the site to go live.

### Site details

The **Site details** section shows the following site details:

- **Name** - editable field for the name of the site that helps you identify the site among all other sites that you work on.
- **Owner** - name of the owner of the site.
- **Created on** - when the site was created.
- **Modified on** - when the site was last modified.
- **Type** - shows whether the site is in trial or production. When in trial, you can also select **Convert** to convert the site into production.
- **Language** - the language of the site.
- **URL** - the URL to access the site.
- **Application ID** - a unique ID that helps differentiate the current app from all other apps. To copy the Application ID, select the copy icon.
- **Early Upgrade** - enable or disable early upgrade for this site to access newly launched features earlier.
- **Admin actions** - takes you to the admin center for site admin actions such as adding a custom domain, enable/disable CDN, or set up IP restrictions.

You can also **Run Site Checker**. More information: [Run Site Checker](../admin/site-checker.md)

### Go-live checklist

Go-live checklist includes interactive tasks that guide you to review and complete the recommended actions. This interactive experience includes running the site checker, and configuring several other settings for the site that help you prepare the site before the general roll out.
