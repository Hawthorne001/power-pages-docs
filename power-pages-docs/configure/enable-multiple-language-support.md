# Enable multiple-language website support

Business isn't confined to a single region or a language. A single website can display content in multiple languages to reach customers around the world. The content of your website can be translated into multiple languages while maintaining a single content hierarchy.

:::image type="content" source="media/multi-language/multi-language-dropdown.png" alt-text="Multiple-language drop-down list":::  

To enable multiple languages for a website, follow these steps:

1. [Enable languages in a Microsoft Dataverse environment.](/power-platform/admin/enable-languages)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Make sure that the process to enable a language on Dataverse completes before continuing to the next step. It may take an hour or more to provision the languages.
  
1. In the [Portals Management app](portal-management-app.md) 
1. Go to **Website** > **Websites**.
1. Select the website to add language support to.
1. In the **Supported Languages** section under the **General** tab, select **New Website Language**.
1. Fill in the form, including **Portal Language** (a lookup of languages that are activated in the organization and are supported by portals) and **Publishing State**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/multi-language/supported-languages.png" alt-text="Supported languages.":::

You can set the default language of your website by changing the *Default Language* lookup to one of the enabled website languages.

> [!Note]
> - If you activate new languages after the website has been provisioned, you can [import the metadata translations](../admin/import-metadata-translation.md) to get the metadata translated for the newly activated languages.
> - You will also need to update the [language text for any custom labels on Dataverse tables and columns](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/translate-entity-label-text) to appear on forms and lists on portal web pages.

## Supported languages

The table below shows all the languages currently available out of the box. This list can be found by going to the Portals Management app, in the **Content** section and then select **Portal Languages**. The display name of a language can be changed after selecting the language to change from this page.

## Create content in multiple languages

1. Open the [Portal Management app](portal-management-app.md).
2. Go to **Website** > **Content** > **Web Pages** to see a list of content. For each webpage, there will be a parent version of the page and a child version of the page for each language activated for the website.
3. To add a new localization of the page, go to a base page and scroll down to **Localized Content**.
4. Select **+ New Web Page** on to create a lookup for the localized version.

    :::image type="content" source="media/multi-language/add-new-localized-content.png" alt-text="Add new localized content":::

> [!Note]
> The configuration fields on the home page of a content page is not inherited to the existing content pages. They are used only in creation of new content pages. You must update the content page configurations individually.

Knowledge articles will only be displayed if they've been translated into the language the user sets the website to be displayed in. However, forums and blogs allow for more control over how they're presented in other languages. Specifying a language for a forum or blog is optional. If a language isn't specified, the forum or blog will be displayed in the primary language of the organization. If you want the forum or blog specific to a language, you must create it and assign the language to it.

Web link sets are the navigation links at the top of the portal. In the Portal Management app, go to **Content** > **Web Link Sets** to update the translated text of the menu items. When a language is active for the website, a new set of links is created for the newly activated language.

:::image type="content" source="media/multi-language/active-weblink-new-language.png" alt-text="Active web link for new language":::

## View website in a different language

Once the languages have been enabled, by default, users will see a drop-down on the web pages, which will allow them to switch the currently viewed content to different enabled website languages.

:::image type="content" source="media/multi-language/multi-language-dropdown.png" alt-text="Multiple-language drop-down list":::  

## Configure user's default language

To avoid choosing the language from the drop-down each time, website users can set the default language by entering it in the **Preferred Language field** within the user profile section.  

:::image type="content" source="media/multi-language/preferred-language.png" alt-text="Preferred language":::

> [!Note]
> You will need to configure [table permissions](../security/table-permissions.md) on the website language table (adx_portallanguage) to allow read and append access linked to the default authenticated user web role to allow for users to choose their default language.
