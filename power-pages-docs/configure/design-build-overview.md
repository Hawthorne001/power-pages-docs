# Overview of designing and building sites

The Power Pages [design studio](../getting-started/use-design-studio.md) allows you to quickly create and edit powerful websites.

> [!NOTE]
> To edit sites using the design studio, you will need to be assigned the [required roles and permissions](../admin/admin-roles.md#required-roles-and-permissions) in the same Microsoft Dataverse environment as your site. 

The design studio has five marquee experiences—called *workspaces*—that focus on specific user jobs:

- **Pages workspace** enables you to design and build webpages with in-context editing and add content with no-code and low-code widgets such as text, image, video, Power BI reports, lists, forms, and others. [Learn more about the Pages workspace](../getting-started/first-page.md).

- **Styling workspace** lets you apply global site styles. You can apply corporate branding updates, and review the changes in the preview on the right side of the app window. Styling offers 13 preset themes. For each theme, you can customize the color palette, background color, font styles, button styles, and section margins. [Learn more about the Styling workspace](../getting-started/style-site.md).

- **Data workspace** lets you easily model, visualize, and manage business data for the site with tables, forms, and lists. You can create and edit Dataverse tables for the site and create new or edit existing model-driven forms and views. Changes made in the Data workspace are stored in the Common data store. [Learn more about the Data workspace](../getting-started/use-data-workspace.md).

- **Set up workspace** enables site administrators to configure site settings such as identity providers, security and permissions, go-live configurations, and progressive web app (PWA) settings. [Learn more about the Set up workspace](setup-workspace.md).

- **Security workspace** provides a single interface to monitor, protect, and manage your Power Pages sites. [Learn more about the Security workspace](../getting-started/use-security-workspace.md)
