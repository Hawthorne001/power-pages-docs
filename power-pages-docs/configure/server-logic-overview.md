# Server logic overview (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Power Pages server logic lets makers run JavaScript securely on the server, adding extensibility directly to the site runtime.  
   
Because server logic runs on the server, it's hidden from the browser and protected by web roles and table permissions. You add logic in Power Pages Studio and author it using Visual Studio Code, which provides IntelliSense and compile-time validation.  

Dataverse stores code and configuration, so server logic benefits from the same lifecycle management and deployment pipelines as other Power Pages components.

These features are subject to [supplemental terms of use](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189520), and are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

## Language support

Server logic lets developers write native JavaScript code compliant with the [ECMAScript 2023](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2023/) standard. Hosting environment doesn't provide access to browser-specific APIs or libraries, like `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, or other DOM-related features typically available in client-side JavaScript.  

## What you can do with Server logic

Server logic in Power Pages allows makers and developers to move critical operations from the browser to the server for improved control, scalability, and security. It enables your site to perform complex tasks and integrations without exposing sensitive logic or data on the client side.

With Server logic, you can:
- Connect to external services and APIs : Integrate securely with REST APIs, Azure Functions, or other business systems to exchange data, trigger actions, or retrieve dynamic information.
- Perform secure data operations : Execute Dataverse operations—such as querying, updating, or deleting records—on the server, applying business logic and validation consistently.
- Run custom logic and transformations : Process or manipulate data before returning it to the client. For example, calculate totals, validate business rules, or enrich data using external lookups.
- Return processed responses to pages : Send only the required and filtered data to client pages, ensuring faster rendering and reduced payloads.
- Simplify secure authentication : Manage service credentials and API keys on the server rather than in client code, maintaining secure and compliant integration practices.

## Benefits of using Server logic

Server logic brings enterprise-grade extensibility to Power Pages, helping organizations build more secure, scalable, and maintainable web experiences.

Key benefits include:
-	Enhanced security : Business logic, secrets, and API keys are executed and stored on the server—never exposed in the browser or to end users.
-	Integration flexibility : Connect Power Pages seamlessly with external systems, including Azure Functions, REST APIs, Dataverse actions, and business services.
-	Improved performance and efficiency : Offload heavy computations, validations, and data processing to the server, reducing client-side workload and improving page responsiveness.
-	Consistency across channels : Apply the same logic across web pages, forms, and integrations, ensuring uniform data validation and behavior throughout the application.
-	Centralized maintenance : Update or refine logic in one place without redeploying or editing multiple client scripts or pages.


## Securing the Server logic 

To execute code in server logic, users must have the appropriate permissions configured by the maker. Access is governed by web roles and table permissions, which also determine whether server logic can access specific tables.

### Authenticating server logic API 

You don't need to include custom authentication code. Authentication and authorization are managed by the application session. All server logic API calls must include a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token.  

## Governance setting for anonymous access 

Server logic integrates with Dataverse and external services to perform complex computations that might use data from external systems. When administrators enforce the [governance control](../security/disable-anonymous-access), any integration initiated by anonymous users, especially those involving external systems, is blocked.  

## Site settings

The following optional site settings help configure server logic: 

| Name                | Description             | Default                |
|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| ServerLogic/Enabled | Enable / Disable feature                 | true  |
| ServerLogic/AllowedDomains    | Restrict which external domains can be called | All domains allowed |
| ServerLogic/TimeoutInSeconds        | Maximum execution time (in seconds)      | 120    |
| ServerLogic/MaxMemoryUsageInBytes   | Maximum memory per function              | 10 MB  |
| ServerLogic/AllowNetworkingToAllDomains | Allow networking across domains         | True   |

## Server logic API URL 

Construct the API URL using this format:   
https://\<site-url\>/\_api/serverlogics/\<server-logic-name\>   
   
Example:   
https://contoso.powerappsportals.com/_api/serverlogics/exchangerate 

 

## Supported HTTP methods 

Each method maps to a function you define in server logic: 

| Method  | Function signature    | Usage                              |
|---------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| GET     | function get() { }    | Retrieve data.                     |
| POST    | function post() { }   | Create records or send new data.   |
| PATCH   | function patch() { }  | Update part of a record (upsert).  |
| PUT     | function put() { }    | Replace or update records.         |
| DELETE  | function del() { }    | Delete records or fields.          |
