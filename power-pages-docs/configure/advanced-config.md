# Advanced configuration

Power Pages is built on the foundation of Power Apps portals. Many of the tools and methods used to configure sites in Power Pages use the functionality of Power Apps portals. 

The following are advanced features of Power Pages that are configured by using Power Apps portals.

## Configure search

In Power Pages, you can search site content and Dataverse records by using the global search functionality.

More information: [Search](/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/search)

## Power BI

To view dashboards and reports from [Power BI on pages](../getting-started/add-power-bi.md) in a site, you must first enable Power BI visualization from the Power Platform admin center.

More information: [Set up Power BI Integration](/powerapps/maker/portals/admin/set-up-power-bi-integration)

## Web files

A web file represents a downloadable file in a Power Pages site, used to store images, documents, and any other file type.

More information: [Create and manage web files](/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/web-files)

## SharePoint integration

You can upload and display documents to and from SharePoint Online directly on a basic form or advanced form in a site. 

More information: [Manage SharePoint documents](/powerapps/maker/portals/manage-sharepoint-documents)

## Multiple languages

A site can display content in multiple languages to reach customers around the world. The content of your Power Pages site can be translated into multiple languages while maintaining a single content hierarchy.

More information: [Enable multiple-language portal support](/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/enable-multiple-language-support)

## Configure content delivery network

A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. CDNs' store cached content on edge servers in point-of-presence (POP) locations that are close to end users, to minimize latency. You can configure Power Pages to use a CDN.
