# Tutorial: Use dataset code components

In this tutorial, you'll create a sample component using Power Apps component framework.  Power Apps component framework empowers professional developers and app makers to create code components for model-driven and canvas aps.  These code components can provide an enhanced experience for users working with data on forms, views, and dashboards. More information: [Use code components in Power Pages](component-framework.md)

> [!NOTE]
> - This tutorial is based on the existing Power Apps component framework tutorial that walks you through [Power Apps grid control (preview)](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/the-power-apps-grid-control) component on list and sub grid on blank page. You can also use any existing or new component, add it to any other web page for this tutorial. In this case, be sure to your component and web page when following the steps in this tutorial. To learn which code components are supported in portals, see [Use code components in portals](component-framework.md). 

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class ="checklist"] 
> * Create a sample component using Power Apps component framework
> * Package the component to a Microsoft Dataverse environment
> * Configure Power Pages to add the component to a web page
> * Visit your Power Pages web page to interact with the component

## Prerequisites

- Portal version [9.4.9.xx](/power-platform/released-versions/portals/portalupdate949x) or higher. 
- Dataverse base portal package [9.3.2209.x](/power-apps/maker/portals/versions/package-version-9.3.2209) or higher. 

## Step 1 - Create your first component

Complete the [Create your first component](/power-apps/developer/component-framework/implementing-controls-using-typescript) tutorial.

> [!NOTE] 
> At the end of the [Create your first component](/power-apps/developer/component-framework/implementing-controls-using-typescript), you'll have a component named TSLinearInputComponent packaged and uploaded to your Dataverse environment.

## Step 2 - Add the code component to views or subgrids in a model-driven app

To add your component to the **Account** table, views and subgrids, follow the steps here [Convert views and subgrids into editable grids (preview)](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/the-power-apps-grid-control) 

## Step 3 - Add code component to a list and subgrid in portal

In this step, you'll create a new list in the Portal Management app and then add the component to the created list. You can also use an existing list instead. 

### Step 3.1 - Add the code component to lists

The following steps outline how to add the control to a list component.

1. Open the [Portals Management app](portal-management-app.md).

1. On the left pane, under **Content**, select **list.** 

1. Select **New**. 

1. Enter **Name**. For example, *Account list with code component*. 

1. For **Table Name**, select the table that you added the code component to earlier in this tutorial. 

1. Select your portal **website**. 

1. Add views under advance setting grid. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-pcf-code/add-views.png" alt-text="Add views in advanced settings grid.":::

1. Select **Use a configured code component** as **Yes** 

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-pcf-code/configured-code-component.png" alt-text="Use code component.":::

You can now add the list component to a page. See [Add a list](../getting-started/add-list.md) for details on adding a list to a webpage.

### Step 3.2 - Add the code component to sub grid 

The control can also be enabled on a sub-grid.

1. Open the [Portals Management app](portal-management-app.md).

1. On the left pane, under **Content**, select **Basic Forms**. 

1. Select the basic form you created in the previous step. 

1. Select **Related**. 

1. Select **Basic Form Metadata.** 

1. Select **New Basic Form Metadata**. 

1. Select Type as **Subgrid**. 

1. Select **Subgrid Name**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-pcf-code/add-component-subgrid.png" alt-text="Add code component to subgrid.":::

1. For **Control Style**, select **Code component**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-pcf-code/control-style.png" alt-text="Select Control style.":::

The form will need to be added to a webpage. See [Add form](../getting-started/add-form.md) for details on adding a form component to a webpage.

## Add dataset-based code component using liquid tag

Data set based code components can be added using the `codecomponent` Liquid template tag. The key for denoting the code component that needs to be loaded is passed in using the name attribute. The key can be the GUID (which is the code component ID) or the name of the code component imported into Microsoft Dataverse. 

See [Liquid overview](../configure/liquid/liquid-overview.md) for details on using Liquid with Power Pages.

The values of the properties that the code component expects need to be passed in as a key/value pair separated by "**:**" (colon sign), where the key is the property name and the value is the JSON string value. 

```json
{% codecomponent name: <ID or name> <property1:value> <property2:value> %}
```

For example, to add a code component expecting an input parameter named *controlValue*, use the following Liquid template tag:

```json
{% codecomponent name:abc_SampleNamespace.MapControl controlValue:'Space Needle' controlApiKey:<API Key Value>%}
```

For more information, see [Liquid template tag for code components](liquid/component-framework-liquid.md).

## Limitations

Actions and metadata filter configuration on lists and subgrid are not supported with Power Apps grid control.
