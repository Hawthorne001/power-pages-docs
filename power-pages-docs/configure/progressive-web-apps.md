# Overview of sites as progressive web apps

You can enable your site as a progressive web app (PWA), with native app–like look and feel, by using the [Set up workspace](setup-workspace.md) in the Power Pages design studio.

We're applying progressive web app technology to convert a site to a multiplatform-supported app, which works on all platforms (Android/iOS/Windows/Chrome) and all form factors (mobile/desktop/tablet). It even works on specialized platforms like Chromebooks.

PWAs are built for cross-platform interoperability through browser support that provides users with a native app–like experience. PWAs bring a seamless experience for users across different web browsers. These apps can be installed from the browser or through app stores. PWAs can be distributed to end users through app stores or a browser-based download and install. For more information, see [Build and distribute progressive web apps](build-progressive-web-apps.md). This capability enables external and internal customers to use a portal as an app. They can also pin the app directly to the home screen on their mobile device.

PWAs can be used for both online and offline scenarios. As a maker, you can choose to enable specific pages in your site to be available offline (the content on these pages is read-only).
