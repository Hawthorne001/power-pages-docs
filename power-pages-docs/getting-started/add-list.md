# Add list

A list is a data-driven configuration used to render a list of records without the need for a developer to surface the grid in the portal. Lists use Dataverse views to display records on the portal.

A list displays data in a grid view on Power Pages sites. Lists on pages are created from Dataverse table views. Dataverse table views can be created by using the [Data workspace](use-data-workspace.md) or from [model-driven apps created in Power Apps](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/accessing-view-definitions/). You can use them on pages or with [forms](add-form.md) to build a complete web application.

> [!TIP]
> We've created a series of tutorials and videos for you to learn to use Power Pages and how create a view and add a list to a page. For more information, go to [Tutorial: Add a list to a page](tutorial-add-list-to-page.md).

To add a list:

1. Open the [design studio](use-design-studio.md) to edit the content and components of the page.

1. Select the page you want to edit.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need to enable [table permissions](../security/table-permissions.md) to ensure that users will be able to view the data on the lists.

You can also specify more options using the [Portal Management app](../configure/portal-management-app.md).

## Duplicate a list

From the Pages workspace inside design studio, you can select the ellipsis (**...**) on the list component to duplicate a list, move it up or down within the section, or delete it.

## List filters

Makers can add list filters to their Power Pages site from the design studio.  

### Filter types

All types of metadata filters supported in [Portal Management app](../configure/portal-management-app.md) are configurable within Power Pages studio and each one has a simplified name, which matches its visualization.  Makers can also edit/delete the filters when working with list component inside the design studio.

| Filter Visualization | Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Text    | Filters the list by using a text box to search for matching text in a selected attribute of the given table.        |
|Checkbox, Dropdown, and Radio Button    | Makers can choose between checkboxes, dropdowns, and radio buttons as visualizations for their filter type. More options to configure the filter appear once makers pick the column.  These options vary based on the column's data type.       |
|Custom   | Filters the list by using a FetchXML filter condition. When a maker selects custom, a text box appears.  Makers enter their XML statement in this field.        |
