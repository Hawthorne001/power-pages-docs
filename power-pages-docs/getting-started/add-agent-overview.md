# Add an agent - overview

An agent enhances your Microsoft Power Pages site by providing instantaneous support to your users. Within minutes, you can integrate an agent to provide natural-language responses to visitor questions, improve the user experience, and boost satisfaction.

There are two main ways to add an agent to your site. The method you choose determines the agent’s default capabilities:

- **Set up workspace**: Agents added from the set up workspace can answer questions based on your site’s information. Learn more in [Add an agent from the set up workspace](#add-an-agent).
- **Start from a form**: Agents created from a form help users complete tasks related to that form, such as creating a record. Learn more in [Build an agent from a form](https://<LinkPlaceholder>).

If you want one agent to both answer questions and help users create records, start with the set up workspace option. Later, you can add form-based capabilities to the same agent instead of creating a new one. Alternatively, you can create separate agents for different tasks. If your site has multiple agents, visitors will see all the agents they have access to in the chat window and can switch between them as needed.

## Extend or customize an agent

After you add an agent, you can enhance its capabilities in the following ways:

- Use an agent created in [Microsoft Copilot Studio](agent-how-to.md).
- [Configure an agent to use Bing search to generate answers from public data](force-bing-index.md).
- Use [Omnichannel in Dynamics 365 Customer Service with your agent](../configure/omnichannel.md), and transition customers to a live agent as required.
