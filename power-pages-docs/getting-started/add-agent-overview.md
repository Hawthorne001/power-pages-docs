# What is an agent?

An agent makes your Microsoft Power Pages site more helpful by giving instant support to users. In minutes, you add an agent that gives natural language responses to visitor questions, improves the user experience, and boosts satisfaction.

You can add an agent to your site in two main ways. The method you choose sets the agent’s default capabilities:

- **Set up workspace**: Agents you add from the set up workspace answer questions based on your site’s information. Learn more in [Add an agent from the set up workspace](enable-agent.md).
- **Start from a form**: Agents you create from a form help users with tasks related to that form, like creating a record. Learn more in [Build an agent from a form](build-agent-from-form.md).

To let one agent both answer questions and help users create records, start with the set up workspace option. Later, add form-based capabilities to the same agent instead of creating a new one. Or, create separate agents for different tasks. If your site has multiple agents, visitors see all the agents they can use in the chat window and can switch between them as needed.

After you select a specific agent, the experience for that agent appears. To get back to the list of agents, select the button in the upper-right corner.

## Extend or customize an agent

After you add an agent, enhance its capabilities in these ways:

- Use an agent created in [Microsoft Copilot Studio](agent-how-to.md).
- [Configure an agent to use Bing search to generate answers from public data](force-bing-index.md).
- Use [Omnichannel in Dynamics 365 Customer Service with your agent](../configure/omnichannel.md), and transition customers to a live agent as needed.
