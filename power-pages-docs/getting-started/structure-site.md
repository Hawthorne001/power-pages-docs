# Create site structure

When you've created a few pages, the page hierarchy is displayed in a nested structure on the **Main navigation** menu.

To change page hierarchy:

1. Select the ellipsis (**...**) on the page you want to move.

1. In the menu that appears, choose the action you want.

    | Action | Description |
    | ----------- | ----------- |
    | Move to other pages| Moves the page into the **Other pages** section. |
    | Move to main navigation | Shows the page in the header of the home page. |
    | Move up | Moves the page up in the hierarchy. |
    | Move down | Moves the page down in the hierarchy. |
    | Add a new subpage | Adds a child page to the selected page. The child page inherits the page template of its parent page. |
    | Promote this subpage | Decreases the indent and moves the child page to the level of the previous page in the hierarchy. |
    | Make this a subpage | Increases the indent and makes the page a child page of the previous page in the hierarchy. |
    | Page Settings | Update page name, partial URL, and [Page permissions](../security/page-security.md). |
    | Edit code | Allows you to edit the page in [Visual Studio Code for the Web](../configure/visual-studio-code-editor.md). |
    | Duplicate | This will create a copy of the webpage. Note that [form](add-form.md), [multistep form](multistep-forms.md), and [list](add-list.md) components will not be duplicated but will be referenced from the duplicated page. |
    | Delete | Deletes the page. |
