# Overview of the Security workspace

Security workspace provides a single interface to monitor, protect, and manage [security features for Power Pages](../security/power-pages-security.md). You can quickly check how secure your sites are with scan, make them more secure by setting up web roles, page and table permissions, web application firewall, authentication, site visibility, and HTTP headers through advanced settings.

## Monitor

### Run scan (preview)

[Run a security scan](../security/security-scan.md) to enhance your site's resilience by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities, safeguarding it against potential threats and ensuring a secure online environment for users.
