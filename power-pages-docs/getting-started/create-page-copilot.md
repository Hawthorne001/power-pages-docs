# Create an AI-generated webpage using Copilot

You can create a new page for your site by describing the purpose of the page. Copilot generates the HTML for the page with relevant text copy and images from the description. Copilot adds the page to the main navigation of the site. You can refine and edit it using Copilot and the WYSIWYG editor.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is now generally available (GA) for all regions with the exception of DOD.

## Generate a webpage

To use Copilot to generate a webpage:

1. Go to [Power Pages](https://make.powerpages.microsoft.com/).
1. Go to the **Pages** workspace.

# [+ Page button](#tab/copilot)

1. Select **+ Page** in the upper-left corner.
1. Use Copilot to describe a page you want to create using natural language.
1. To send Copilot your request, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or select the paper airplane icon in the lower-right corner of the text box.

1. After Copilot creates your page, select **Keep it** if you like the result or **Delete page** if you don't.

# [Copilot sidecar](#tab/other)

1. Select the **Copilot** icon.

1. Within the Copilot sidecar, select **Page design** -> **Create a page**.

1. Describe the page that you want to generate using AI. Choose from the starter prompts displayed in the sidecar, or write your own prompts directly in the text input field. For example, "create an FAQ page for student loans."

    If you select a starter prompt, it appears in the text input field. You can modify these prompts before submitting them.

1. To send Copilot your request, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or select the paper airplane icon in the lower-right corner of the text box.

Copilot generates the page and adds it to the main navigation. You can review the page and the content. You can edit sections, text, and images in the page using the WYSIWYG editor.

## Discard a Copilot-generated webpage

If you don't want to keep the page that Copilot generated, you can:

- Undo the changes. This action reverts the Copilot changes and deletes the page.

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot-generated pages will reference images that are saved as [web files](../configure/web-files.md).

## Edit a page with Copilot

Additionally, you can edit a page with Copilot by typing the following commands in the Copilot input field box:

|Command  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Add a section    | Copilot creates a new section with text copy and images, and appends the section to the end of the page.         |
|Add a form     | To learn how to add a form using Copilot, see [Create AI-generated form using Copilot](add-form-copilot.md)         |
