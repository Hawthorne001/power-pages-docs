# Create an AI-generated webpage using Copilot

You can create a new page for your site by describing the purpose of the page. Copilot generates the HTML for the page with relevant text copy and images from the description. The page is added to the main navigation of the site, and can be refined and edited using Copilot and the WYSIWYG editor.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is now generally available (GA) for all regions with the exception of Canada, the Government Cloud (GCC), and the Government Community Cloud – High (GCC High).

## Generate a webpage

To use Copilot to generate a webpage:

1. Go to [Power Pages](https://make.powerpages.microsoft.com/).

1. Go to the **Pages** workspace.

1. Select the **Copilot** icon.
   :::image type="content" source="media/create-page-copilot/copilot-icon.svg" alt-text="The Copilot icon in the Pages workspace.":::

1. Within the Copilot sidecar, select **Page design** -> **Create a page**.

1. Describe the page that you want to generate using AI. Choose from the starter prompts displayed in the sidecar, or write your own prompts directly in the text input field. For example, "Create an FAQ page for student loans."

    If you select a starter prompt, it appears in the text input field. You can modify these prompts before submitting them.

1. Press the Enter key or select the paper airplane icon in the lower-right corner of the text box to send Copilot your request.

    :::image type="content" source="media/create-page-copilot/copilot-page-prompt.svg" alt-text="Screenshot of Power Pages Copilot sidecar with page prompts displayed and the paper airplane icon emphasized.":::

The page is generated and added to the main navigation. You can review the page and the content. Sections, text, and images in the page are low-code editable using the WYSIWYG editor.

## Discard a Copilot-generated webpage

If you don't want to keep the page that Copilot generated, you can:

- Undo the changes. This action reverts the Copilot changes and deletes the page.

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot-generated pages will reference images that are saved as [web files](../configure/web-files.md).

## Edit a page with Copilot

Additionally, you can edit a page with Copilot by typing the following commands in the Copilot input field box:

|Command  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Add a section    | Copilot creates a new section with text copy and images, and appends the section to the end of the page.         |
|Add a form     | To learn how to add a form using Copilot, see [Create AI-generated form using Copilot](add-form-copilot.md)         |
