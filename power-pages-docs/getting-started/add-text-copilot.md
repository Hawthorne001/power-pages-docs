# Add AI-generated text using Copilot

An easy way to add text to your Power Pages website is to ask Copilot to create it for you. Describe the text you need. Copilot generates copy based on your description and offers a preview for you to check. You can [add the text](add-text.md) to your site as it is, edit it first, or start over with a different description.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is now generally available (GA) for all regions except for DOD.

## Generate text with Copilot

1. Go to the [Pages workspace](first-page.md) and select a page for your form.
1. Select the **Text** component.
1. In the text component toolbar, select **Copilot**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/add-text-copilot/copilot-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a text component in Power Pages, with the Copilot icon highlighted.":::

1. Describe the text that you want to Copilot to generate; for example, "I want to describe the benefits of student loan options at Contoso university." You can use up to 1,500 characters in your description.

    :::image type="content" source="media/add-text-copilot/contoso-example-description.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the text generation box with a description entered.":::

1. To send your description to Copilot, press the Enter key or select the paper airplane icon in the lower-right corner of the text box.

1. Check the preview below your description and refine the text as needed.

    - To refine your description and generate new text, select **Rewrite**.
    - To keep the generated text but make it sound more friendly, casual, educational, professional, or excited, select **Change the tone**.
    - To keep the generated text but make it more concise or expand on it, select **Adjust the length**.
    - To give Copilot more information, select **Add more details for Copilot to work with**.
    - To give Microsoft feedback on how well Copilot interpreted your description or refinement, select the thumbs-up or thumbs-down icon.

1. To add the text to the page, select **Add to page**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> AI-generated text can contain mistakes or be otherwise inappropriate for your intended use. Always review, edit, and verify AI-generated text before you [change your site's visibility](../security/site-visibility.md) to public.

After the text is added to the page, you can edit it the same way you [edit any page component](customize-pages.md).
