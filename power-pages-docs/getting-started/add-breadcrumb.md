1. Select the page you want to edit.

1. Select the section you want to add the breadcrumb to.

1. Hover over any editable canvas area, then select the **Breadcrumb** component from the component panel.

## Edit a Breadcrumb 

After a breadcrumb control is added, select the breadcrumb control to open the properties bar. From here, you can configure your breadcrumb's properties.

    - hidden
    - text only
    - icon only
    - icon and text
- font style
        
> [!NOTE]
> Any changes to the breadcrumb design will apply to all breadcrumb instances across the site.

## Customizing the Breadcrumb component 

Breadcrumb component is the **Pages Breadcrumb** web template that appears in Portals Management app. If the web template is edited, all breadcrumb instances across design studio appear as [custom components](../configure/web-templates-as-components.md).

If the Pages Breadcrumb web template was mistakenly edited, the original web template code can be recovered by renaming the Pages Breadcrumb web template in Portals Management App. Go to design studio,  open the component panel, and add breadcrumb component to a webpage. This action creates a new copy of Pages Breadcrumb web template.
