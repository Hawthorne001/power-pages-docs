# Dataverse and Power Pages

When creating a site, makers often use a database to store records related to business information. Microsoft Power Platform's cloud-based data service, [Dataverse](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro), stores information like a traditional database, but with added benefits such as security features, analytics, and automation. 

You can build applications&mdash;including Power Pages sites&mdash;that are connected to Dataverse.

## Data workspace

Makers are able to create and modify Dataverse [tables](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/entity-overview) directly in the design studio by using the [data workspace](use-data-workspace.md).

Dataverse gives makers the ability to use Power Apps to create [model-driven apps](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/) and to work with data using a [view](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/create-edit-views) of data records in a grid or list. Makers can then use a [form](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/create-design-forms) to add, update, and view each record. 

Power Pages sites are unique, but they have components that use these model-driven app views and forms as a foundation to build interactive, data-driven webpages.

In data workspace, a maker can use pre-existing or new Dataverse model-driven app views to build [list](add-list.md) components and pre-existing or new Dataverse model-driven app forms to create [basic](add-form.md) or [multistep form](multistep-forms.md) components on pages.
